# How to Share Neural Collapse with a Friend

## üöÄ Option 1: Deploy Online (Recommended)

### Using Vercel (Easiest):

1. **Install Vercel CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. **Deploy the server:**
```bash
cd server
vercel
```

3. **Deploy the game:**
   - Upload `game.html` and `game.js` to Vercel
   - Or use any static hosting

4. **Update API URL in game.js:**
   - Change `const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api';`
   - To your Vercel backend URL

**Friend Access:** They just visit your Vercel URL!

## üè† Option 2: Local Network Share (Same WiFi)

### Setup:

1. **Find your IP address:**
```bash
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., `192.168.1.5`)

2. **Server is already configured** (I just updated CORS for you!)

3. **Share with your friend:**
   - Game URL: `http://YOUR-IP:63342/game.html`
   - Backend: Automatically connects to `http://YOUR-IP:3000`

4. **Your friend needs to:**
   - Be on the same WiFi network
   - Open the URL you give them
   - Create their own account

**Note:** Your computer must stay on for this to work!

### Package to Send:

1. **Zip these folders:**
   - `server/` (entire folder)
   - `game.html`
   - `game.js`
   - `README.md`

2. **Send via:**
   - Google Drive
   - WeTransfer
   - Email (if <25MB)

3. **Friend's Setup Instructions:**

```bash
# 1. Extract the zip
# 2. Open terminal in server folder
cd server

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start the server
npm run dev

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Database:** Currently using SQLite
   - Each person has their own local database
   - For true multiplayer, need shared database (PostgreSQL)

2. **Save Data:**
   - Saves in `server/dev.db` file
   - Sending files = friend gets fresh start
   - Deploy online = shared server for everyone

3. **Accounts:**
   - Each player needs their own account
   - Separate progress per account
   - Can have multiple people on same server

4. **Performance:**
   - Local: Super fast
   - Deployed: Depends on hosting
   - Both work great!
