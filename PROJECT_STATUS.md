## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### For Backend Developer:
1. Implement resource production system
   - Create production calculation service
   - Add resource collection endpoint
   - Add resource production timers

2. Implement base building endpoints
   - POST /api/base/build
   - POST /api/base/upgrade
   - GET /api/base (get player's base state)

3. Add building configuration data
   - Create building configs
   - Define costs and timers
   - Define production rates

### For Unity Developer:
1. Create Unity project in `client/` folder
2. Import provided C# scripts
3. Create login/register scene
   - UI layout
   - Connect to NetworkManager
   - Test authentication

4. Create base scene
   - Grid layout for buildings
   - Resource display UI
   - Building menu

5. Implement resource display
   - Listen to EventBus updates
   - Update UI elements

### For Game Designer:
1. Balance resource costs
2. Define building upgrade paths
3. Design hero stats and skills
4. Plan combat mechanics
5. Create mission content

## 📞 API Endpoints

### ✅ Implemented
- `GET /health` - Server health check
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Create new player
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Player login

### 📋 To Implement
- `GET /api/player/profile` - Get player data
- `GET /api/base` - Get base state
- `POST /api/base/build` - Build structure
- `POST /api/base/upgrade` - Upgrade building
- `POST /api/base/collect` - Collect resources
- `GET /api/heroes` - Get player heroes
- `POST /api/heroes/recruit` - Recruit hero
- `PUT /api/heroes/:id/upgrade` - Upgrade hero
- `POST /api/combat/start` - Start combat
- `GET /api/alliance/:id` - Get alliance info
- And more...

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Access tokens expire in 7 days
- Refresh tokens expire in 30 days
- CORS configured for specified origins
- Input validation needed (TODO)

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Current Setup (Development)
- SQLite database (single file)
- No Redis cache
- Single server instance
- Good for: Development, testing, small player base

### Production Recommendations
- Switch to PostgreSQL
- Add Redis for caching
- Implement load balancing
- Add CDN for assets
- Database indexing
- Rate limiting
