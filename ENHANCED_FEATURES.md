# Enhanced Base Building Features

## 🎉 New Features Added!

### ⬆️ Building Upgrades

**How it works:**
- Click on any built building to open its info modal
- See current level, production rate, and stats
- View upgrade costs and benefits
- Upgrade buildings up to max level (5-10 depending on building type)
- Each upgrade increases production by 1x (Level 2 = 2x production, Level 3 = 3x, etc.)

**Upgrade Costs:**
- Costs increase with each level (1.5x multiplier for production buildings, 1.8x for special buildings)
- Visual indicators show if you can afford the upgrade (green = can afford, red = too expensive)

**Max Levels:**
- Production buildings: Level 10
- Defense & Special buildings: Level 5
- Max level buildings show a trophy 🏆 icon

### 📊 Resource Caps

**Storage Limits:**
- ⚡ Energy Cores: 5,000 cap
- 🤖 Nanobots: 2,500 cap
- 🔩 Scrap Metal: 2,500 cap
- 💾 Data Chips: 1,000 cap

**Visual Indicators:**
- Resources now show as `current/max` (e.g., "1000/5000")
- Color changes based on fullness:
  - **Green** (0-69%): Normal
  - **Orange** (70-89%): Getting full
  - **Red** (90-100%): Nearly full - spend resources!

**Benefits:**
- Prevents unlimited resource hoarding
- Creates strategic decisions about when to spend
- Storage can be increased with Storage Depot buildings (coming soon)

### 🏢 Enhanced Building Display

### 🎮 Gameplay Improvements

**Strategic Depth:**
1. **Early Game:** Focus on Level 1-3 buildings for balanced production
2. **Mid Game:** Upgrade key production buildings to Level 5-7
3. **Late Game:** Max out all buildings to Level 10

**Production Scaling:**
- Level 1: Base production
- Level 5: 5x production
- Level 10: 10x production!

**Example:**

- Scrap Yard Level 5: +40/hour
- Scrap Yard Level 10: +80/hour

## 🎯 How to Use

### Upgrade a Building:

1. **Build something first**
   - Use the "Available Buildings" section
   - Build at least one production building

2. **Click the building**
   - Click any building in your base grid
   - Modal pops up with full details

3. **Check if you can upgrade**
   - Green costs = you can afford it
   - Red costs = need more resources

4. **Hit the upgrade button**
   - Building levels up instantly
   - Production increases immediately
   - Resources are deducted

5. **Repeat!**
   - Keep upgrading as you earn more resources
   - Balance upgrades across all buildings

### Manage Resources:

1. **Watch the caps**
   - Top bar shows `current/max` for all resources
   - When a resource turns orange/red, spend it!

2. **Strategic spending**
   - Build new buildings when at cap
   - Upgrade existing buildings
   - Recruit heroes

3. **Production optimization**
   - Upgrade production buildings to increase income
   - Higher levels = more resources per hour
   - More resources = faster progression

## 📈 Progression Path

### Beginner (Levels 1-3):
- Build all 4 production buildings
- Get everything to Level 2-3
- Focus on resource variety

### Intermediate (Levels 4-6):
- Upgrade your favorite resource producers
- Start building defense
- Aim for Level 5 on production buildings

### Advanced (Levels 7-10):
- Max out all production buildings
- Build specialized structures
- Optimize for specific strategies

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

1. **Upgrade production buildings first**
   - More resources = faster progression
   - Focus on what you need most

2. **Watch your caps**
   - Don't let resources hit the cap
   - Wasted production = wasted time

3. **Balance your upgrades**
   - Don't max one building and ignore others
   - Balanced production is key

4. **Strategic timing**
   - Save up for big upgrades
   - Upgrade before logging off (so production doesn't waste)

5. **Production compound interest**
   - Higher levels produce exponentially more
   - Early upgrades have biggest impact

## 🔧 Technical Details

**Upgrade Cost Formula:**
```
Cost = Base Cost × (Multiplier ^ (Level - 1))
```

**Production Formula:**
```
Production = Base Rate × Current Level
```

**Storage System:**
```
Resources cap at maximum
Production stops when full
No overflow or waste messages
```
